# Cloud-Based Geo-Spatial Data Retrieval

This repository provides tools for scalable and efficient retrieval of geospatial datasets from cloud-based platforms using Colab notebooks. It is designed for hydrological and environmental applications, with current support for:

- **National Water Model (NWM)** data via **AWS S3**
- **Daymet** daily gridded data via **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Google Cloud Storage**
- **NLDAS** hourly gridded data via **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Google Cloud Storage**

---

## Features

- **NWM Retrieval (AWS):** Access modeled streamflow and hydrological states at high spatial and temporal resolution across CONUS.
- **Daymet Retrieval (GEE/Google Cloud):** Extract and process daily surface weather data for North America.
- **NLDAS Retrieval (GEE/Google Cloud):** Extract and process hourly surface weather data for North America.

> ⚠️ _This repository is under active development and will be expanded to support additional datasets and processing tools._

## Getting Started

To use the implemented modules:

1. Ensure you have access to the required cloud services (AWS, GEE, Google Cloud).
2. Follow the steps detailed in the example notebooks
